With a background in management, serving as a boat captain and working in sales, the
time has come to switch it up. My passion for <code>coding</code>, technology and problem solving
lead me to this new career. I plan to contribute by being a good team player, lead when
prudent and utilize my life experience to the fullest. I self-manage during independent
projects, as well as collaborate as part of a productive team.
